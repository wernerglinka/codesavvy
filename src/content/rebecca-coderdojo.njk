            <p>All Code Savvy CoderDojos have temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. We are currently assessing resuming our CoderDojo activities in the Fall. In the meantime you can find weekly youth-centered challenges that focus on creating new things with computer science. <a href= "https://www.cstogo.org/"><strong> CStoGo.org </strong></a></p>
            <p>Rebecca CoderDojo is free, but you must register in advance.  Space is strictly limited to provide the best possible experience for these young coders and their mentors, who are generously volunteering their time and expertise.

            <h2>What is Volunteering as a Mentor Like?</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical skill level</strong>: Mentors can be at any level of programming experience or no experience at all; you don't need to be an expert programmer to be a great mentor!  We will be using Scratch, AppInventor, Arduino, and Python.</li>

            <li><strong>Time commitment</strong>: Mentors can volunteer for the events they are available for, but are required to participate in the entirety of the events they do sign up for.  Mentors are expected to arrive by 1:00 pm on event days and stay until 3:45 pm.  If you are new, you may need a few hours of preparation time before the event.</li>

            <li><strong>Roles</strong>: On event days, we have a Lead Mentor for each room, along with many enthusiastic mentors!  Each of these is open to all mentors.</li>

           <li><strong>Other opportunities</strong>: On event days, we also need Coordinators that help with check-in, getting parents settled, and logistics.</li>

            <li><strong>Talk to us</strong>: Contact Marie Gottschalk, Program Director for Rebecca CoderDojo, at <a href="mailto:rebeccacoderdojo@gmail.com">rebeccacoderdojo@gmail.com</a>.</li>

                    <p>Rebecca CoderDojo is a Code Savvy initiative in memory of Rebecca Schatz, founder and former executive director of Code Savvy, for her lasting inspiration to encourage all of us, especially kids, to explore technology and be our own innovators. We aim to sustain this inspiration by providing a learning environment for girls to explore coding and become innovators of technology.</p>

                    <p>In 2016, we held 11 events and served over 300 students, many of which were brand new to coding. At these events, we have classrooms for Scratch (easy-to-use language for making games and animations), AppInventor (for learning how to build Android mobile apps), Arduino (a fun way to learn about electricity and how to build circuits), and Python (a general purpose programming language). In addition, over 100 mentors and coordinators have graciously volunteered to mentor students and run our events!</p>
